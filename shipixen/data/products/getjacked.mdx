## Product Overview

GetJacked is more than your everyday workout tracker. It is a hypertrophy (muscle building) focused training app. GetJacked is your personal hypertrophy coach! It combines detailed exercise tracking, progress monitoring, and structured programs to help strength training athletes, bodybuilders, and gym enthusiasts train with purpose.

COMPREHENSIVE EXERCISE DATABASE

Log and track over 200 exercises with clear descriptions, muscle targeting, and form guidance. Whether you're weight lifting heavy compounds or focusing on isolation work, GetJacked works as both an exercise tracker and a gym log for every training style. Perfect for powerlifting, bodybuilding, and weightlifting routines.

INTELLIGENT PROGRESSIVE OVERLOAD

Follow proven principles of strength training with our progressive overload tracker. GetJacked analyzes your training history and suggests weight or rep increases so you keep making steady progress without guesswork. Essential for muscle building and strength gains.

FLEXIBLE TRAINING PROGRAMS

Choose from science-based routines such as full body, push-pull-legs, or upper lower splits. Each workout plan is designed for hypertrophy and can be adapted to your training schedule. You can also use GetJacked as a workout planner to build and save custom routines.

SMART EXERCISE SWAPPING

Don't have access to a machine or barbell? The exercise swap feature recommends alternatives for the same muscle groups with the equipment you do have, keeping your workout on track.

GAMIFIED PROGRESS SYSTEM

Stay motivated with XP points, levels, and achievements. Track your consistency, celebrate milestones, and see your progress over time with built-in progress tracking.

ADVANCED WORKOUT FEATURES

Real-time workout timer and rest tracking

Superset and drop set support

Personal record logging across lifts and full weightlifting tracking

Volume and strength progression charts

Notes and form cues for better technique

Full workout history and analytics

CLOUD SYNC

Your gym data, routines, and progress are stored with secure iCloud sync across all devices.

BUILT FOR SERIOUS LIFTERS

GetJacked focuses on resistance training, progressive overload, and muscle building. Unlike general fitness apps, it's designed for people who want structured strength training tools: bodybuilders, powerlifters, and anyone focused on muscle growth and weightlifting performance.

Start planning, tracking, and progressing with GetJacked today. Use it as your workout tracker, progress tracker, gym log, and routine planner to support consistent strength training and muscle growth.
